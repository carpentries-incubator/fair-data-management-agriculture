## Data Sets

For this lesson we will use four example datasets. These datasets are based on real four long-term experiments, from Kenya, Malawi and the UK, but for the purpose of this lesson, the data has been transformed to illustrate common problems encountered with Excel. This data is not real data, so please don't use it for research!
