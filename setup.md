## Data Sets

Download the [data zip file](data/FAIR-4-LTES-training-datasets.zip.zip) and unzip it to your Desktop

For this lesson we will use four example datasets. These datasets are based on real four long-term experiments, from Kenya, Malawi and the UK, but for the purpose of this lesson, the data has been transformed â€“ it is not real data, so please don't use it for research!
