## Data Sets

This lesson uses four example datasets in MS Excel format and designed to illustrate common problems encountered with Excel. The datasets are based on four real long-term experiments from Kenya, Malawi and the UK, but for the purpose of this lesson, the data has been transformed. The example datasets do not contain real data, so please don't use it for research!
