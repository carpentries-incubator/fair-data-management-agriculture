## Introduction

This lesson is aimed at long-term agricultural experiment (LTE) managers and researchers interested in using long-term agricultural experiments, who want to apply open science and good research data management practices to their LTE data.

The lesson is split into five episodes:

1. Data Sharing
2. FAIR Principles
3. Metadata for LTEs
4. Organising your LTE data
5. Publishing your LTE data

### What are long-term agricultural experiments?
Long-term agricultural experiments are multi-year field experiments testing a range of different treatments to assess the sustainability of crop production and soil health over time ([Johnston & Poulton, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12521)). Field experiments are considered long-term if they have at least 10 years of continuous treatments; the longest running experiment is [Broadbalk wheat](https://www.era.rothamsted.ac.uk/experiment/rbk1), located at Rothamsted, UK, and has been running for 180 years. Globally there are many hundreds of LTEs. The [Global Long-Term agricultural Experiments Network - GLTEN][glten] lists over 250 experiments, while the German [BonaRes](https://lte.bonares.de/) repository contains information for over 450 LTEs in Europe. 

### Why are long-term agricultural experiments important?
LTEs are important sources of long-term data on crops and soils which can be used to assess the sustainability of different agricultural practices and farming systems overtime. Today, as society attempts to address global challenges faced by climate change and food security, this data can provide critical insights and knowledge to help us adapt to and address these challenges.
