## What is open science?

Open science is the movement to make scientific research outputs accessible to all. Open science research outputs include articles, datasets, physical samples, protocols, and code. These outputs are the building blocks of the open science movement.

## What is open data?

Open data is a key building block of the open science movement and key to supporting scientific integrity and reproducibility, but what does open data mean? The [Open Data Handbook](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) defines Open Data as "data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike". 

The full open data definition gives precise details as to what this means in practice. These are:

- Data must be freely available, and at no more than the cost of reproduction.
- Data must me available in a modifiable and convenient form.
- Data must be distributed with terms allowing for its reuse and redistribution.
- Everyone must be able to use the data, there must be no restrictions based on intended use or user.

## Does data have to be open to be shareable?

No. Data can be shared even if it isn't open. 'Data available on request' is still a common practice in research article data availability statements. sucha a statement means the data is not open, but the data can be shared. As we will see in the next episode on FAIR data, data can be FAIR but not open.  

## What are the motivations for open science and data sharing?

::: discussion

Working in groups, identify reasons why many organisations, funders, and governments are promoting open science and data sharing.

- Think about the different motivations and who benefits.
- How might these motivations change for LTE data?

### Return on Investment

A lot of research is funded by the public, either through charities or taxes. For example, [Horizon Europe](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1f107d76-acbe-11eb-9767-01aa75ed71a1) has a €95.5 billion budget for 2021-27, and the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/2023-gates-foundation-annual-letter) aims to pay $9 billion by 2026. But, according to EU report [“Cost-benefit analysis for FAIR research data”](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d375368c-1a0a-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1), €10.2bn is lost every year because of not accessible data. Funders, who are spending billions on research, have a self-interested motivation to have a return on their investments. One method for doing that is to ensure the data they pay to generate is reused as widely as possible, beyond its original purpose. 

Many funders have therefore chosen to adopt policies actively encouraging and in some cases mandating open data sharing: For example, the following funders all promote open data sharing in their data policies:

- Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
- National Science Foundation (US)
- CGIAR (International)
- USAID
- Horizon Europe
- Biodiversa
- UKRI (UK)

### Moral Imperative

For publicly funded research there is a moral imperative to make data openly available. Public money should be invested for public good, namely the public should benefit by not having to pay to access research they already funded, and reducing duplication of effort.

### Reproducbility, transparency, and accountability

Open Science by its nature helps to address reproducibility in science. Sharing data allows other researchers to replicate and results and validate their provenance. This helps to build transparency and trust in research findings. 

By making data openly available researchers can more easily counteract narratives which seek to deliberately misinterpret the data by selectively analysing the data. 

### Personal reward

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
