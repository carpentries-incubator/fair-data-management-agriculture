# FAIR Data Management for Long-term Agriculture Experiments

## General Information

The motivation for developing this lesson was provided by a BBSRC award to deliver training on data management, experimental design, and statistical analysis for managers of long-term agricultural experiments. The training was delivered in Nairobi, Kenya in February/March 2023. This lesson presents the material used for the research data management component of the training, and is provided here primarily as a general resource for researches in the long-term experiments community.  

The lesson is indebted to existing Carpentries and has adapted material from both [FAIR in (biological practice)](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/), and [Ecology Workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/) episodes.
